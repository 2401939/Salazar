    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Justine Jay Salazar, and I am from Tubao, La Union.<br>
      I have a deep passion for technology and online gaming, always eager to explore new advancements in Information Technology.<br>
      When I'm not gaming, I enjoy playing table tennis, diving into the latest trends in software development, and honing my coding skills.<br>
      My dream is to grow as a skilled programmer and contribute to the world of technology.
