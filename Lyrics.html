    <h1>Marilag</h1>
    <h3>Song By Dionela</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Hotshot running in mind nonstop, vertigo
        <br>Curled plot, whiskey in a teapot, ethanol
        <br>Burning like KELT-9b, bright heavenly body
        <br>Only music can define you, and it sounds like-, uh</p>

    <p>(You're like a)
        <br>D'Amalfi in a bar, Au in a goose (hey)
        <br>A photo of me knocked chuck, point blank smooth
        <br>Ikaw ang minsan sa mga palagi
        <br>Ang mitolohiya sa 'yo'y maaari (hey)</p>

    <p>Shawty, you don't need no makeup
        <br>Brown-eyed chick, northside beauty stand out
        <br>Pretty, pretty lady, Big Bang doesn't make sense
        <br>I see God in your face, girl, I mean it</p>

    <p>Marilag
        <br>Ang himala'y sa 'yo ibibintang
        <br>Haven't felt so divine 'til I looked in your eyes (I)
        <br>See my future, baby, loving you saved me</p>

    <p>I wonder what genre was in Heaven
        <br>When I caught a glimpse of it
        <br>Coming from your lips, babe
        <br>Music to my ears<br>Makin' this whole place
        <br>Okay, girl, you are my Friday
        <br>A reason to give my thanks</p>

    <p>I love every part of you
        <br>Can we slow down?
        <br>'Cause I don't wanna miss a thing
        <br>Ibigin ka'y drama sa teatrong upua'y limitado
        <br>Bawat kisap ng mata'y kawalan, oo</p>

    <p>Shawty, you don't need no makeup
        <br>Brown-eyed chick, northside beauty stand out
        <br>Pretty, pretty lady, Big Bang doesn't make sense
        <br>I see God in your face, girl, I mean it</p>

    <p>Marilag
        <br>Ang himala'y sa 'yo ibibintang
        <br>Haven't felt so divine 'til I looked in your eyes (I)
        <br>See my future, baby, loving you saved me (loving you saved me)</p>

    <p>Hotshot running in mind nonstop, vertigo
        <br>Curled plot, whiskey in a teapot, ethanol (oh, I don't wanna live this life without you, girl
        )<br>Burning like KELT-9b, bright heavenly body
        <br>Only music can define you, and it sounds like-</p>
